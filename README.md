# CampusFoodDelivery



## Shawn O'Hara

### Introduction

The impact of the global pandemic has been extremely hard on the restaurant industry. 
An existing start up seeks to address this problem by providing a better way for students to deliver food on campus. 
This project will use a similar dataset created by a graduate team and extend their prototype. 
The goal is to enhance the provided databse with a rating system for both delivery drivers and restraurants.
